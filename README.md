# shoot_em_up
Shooter game, coded in C. 

This project was an end of course assignment in my first semester of my final year of Bachelor's Degree, for our Advanced C class.
Coded in C, using a graphics library made by my university based off SDL called MLV ( http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~boussica/mlv/index.html )

To play use your keyboard's arrows to move the ship, the SPACE key to shoot and the LCTRL (Left-Control) key to consume bonuses. French user guide available in the /doc folder.
